# Directed Weighted Graph

## hello! we glad to see you here!
### This project base on directed weighted graph and including algorithems for finding shortest path from node to node (based on Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm)
### In the project we use the graph and the graph algoritems classes to build an auotomated game like the game packman

### we have 24 games in which the server will let the game know how much pokemons(agent like packman) you have and will randomly creat furit for them to eat

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
for jar virsion please check out our wiki in https://github.com/davidfeust/Directed_Weighted_Graph/wiki/how-to-compile-and-run-the-game-in-your-computer

### Prerequisites
JDK-15
intellij or some other IDE (recommended)

### Installing
Clone that project to your workspace directory

git clone https://github.com/NetanelAlbert/OopEx3-Map-Game.git
Open your IDE and make sure you see the project 

### Running the game
In package gameClient you'll find the calss Ex2. This class has a simple main function that will start the game as soon as you'll run it. enjoy.

### Running the tests
In the package tests that will help you to avoid harmfull changes in code, and also help you to understand each part of the code if you want to.

### now you can feed pikachu in your pc
