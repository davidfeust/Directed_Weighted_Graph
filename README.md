# Directed Weighted Graph & Pokémons Game

## Hello! we glad to see you here!
This project base on directed weighted graph and including algorithms for finding the shortest path from node to node (based on Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm).\
In the project we use the graph, and the graph algorithms classes to build an automated game like the game packman.\
We have 24 games in which the server will let the game know how much Pokémons (agent like packman) you have, and will randomly create fruits for them to eat.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
for create jar version on your own please check out our wiki in: https://github.com/davidfeust/Directed_Weighted_Graph/wiki/how-to-compile-and-run-the-game-in-your-computer

### Prerequisites
Java JDK-15

### Installing
- Clone that project to your workspace directory:\
`
git clone https://github.com/davidfeust/Directed_Weighted_Graph.git
`
- Open the directory and make sure you see the project

### Running the game
- Run Ex2.jar, or from CMD you can run it with args:\
  `java  -jar Ex2.jar <id, level>`
  
### Running the tests
In the package tests that will help you to avoid harmfull changes in code, and also help you to understand each part of the code if you want to.

### Now you can feed pikachu in your pc!
